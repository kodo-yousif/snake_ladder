# snake_ladder
this is snake and ladder game by java  ,  
the board is console based game with little of GUI , 
it can be played 2-4 players and players can left the game when ever they want , 
this is my first ever project in coding ,

so when i started java in college this is was my first real project , and hope you watch it. <br/> thanks.
